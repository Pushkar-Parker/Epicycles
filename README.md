# Epicycles

Hi, this is a code that I have written after taking inspiration from 3Blue1Browns's video on Fourier Series.

The program file 'epicycle.py' you can use and run to make a plot of the images that you want using epicycles. The program takes in the image and finds contours of the image. The information regrading the contours
is later fed to the a function which calculates the fourier series coefficients for the plot and later exponential terms are added to the coefficients. All this is animated and a video is generated to your preffered location.

One thing to keep in mind is the order for the plotting. As you increase the order the complexity increases as well as the the accuracy of the plot.
